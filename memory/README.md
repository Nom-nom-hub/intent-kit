# Memory Directory

This directory contains the persistent knowledge base for the Intent Kit project, including foundational documents that guide all development activities.

## Core Documents

- `constitution.md` - The immutable principles that govern all implementation
- `project_memory.md` - Historical context and decisions for this specific project
- `patterns.md` - Reusable architectural patterns discovered during development

## Purpose

The memory directory serves as the persistent knowledge base for the project. It contains:

1. **Immutable Principles**: The constitutional rules that all code must follow
2. **Historical Context**: Past decisions and their rationales
3. **Reusable Patterns**: Architectural and implementation patterns that proved effective

All development activities reference these documents to ensure consistency and alignment with project principles.
