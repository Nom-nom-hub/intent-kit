# Intent Kit Example: User Authentication System

This example demonstrates how to use Intent Kit to develop a user authentication system following Intent-Driven Development methodology.

## 1. Vision Document

```
# Vision Document: Secure User Authentication System

## User Intent & Outcomes *(mandatory)*

### Intent 1 - Secure User Access (Priority: P1)
Enable users to securely access their accounts with minimal friction while maintaining high security standards.

**Why this priority**: Critical for platform security and user trust

**Independent Validation**: Users can successfully authenticate while security logs show no breach attempts

### Intent 2 - Multiple Authentication Methods (Priority: P2)
Provide users with multiple authentication options (email/password, OAuth, SSO) to accommodate different preferences and security requirements.

**Why this priority**: Improves user experience and adoption

### Intent 3 - Account Recovery (Priority: P3)
Allow users to securely recover access to their accounts when authentication credentials are lost.

**Why this priority**: Critical for user retention

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 99.9% of authentication requests complete successfully within 2 seconds
- **SC-002**: Zero successful unauthorized access attempts per month
- **SC-003**: 95% of users successfully complete authentication on first attempt
- **SC-004**: 90% of account recovery requests result in successful access restoration
```

## 2. Goal Definition

```
# Goal Definition: Authentication System Implementation

## Detailed Objectives *(mandatory)*

### Objective 1: Implement Core Authentication (Priority: P1)
- **Description**: Create secure authentication system supporting email/password
- **Success Criteria**: Users can authenticate securely with 99.9% success rate
- **Metric**: Authentication success rate
- **Target**: 99.9%
- **Baseline**: N/A (new system)
- **Timeline**: Complete within 4 weeks

### Objective 2: Add OAuth Integration (Priority: P2)
- **Description**: Integrate OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, Microsoft)
- **Success Criteria**: Users can authenticate via OAuth with same security standards
- **Metric**: OAuth authentication success rate
- **Target**: 99.5%
- **Timeline**: Complete within 6 weeks

## Validation Approach *(mandatory)*

### Primary Validation Methods
- **VM-001**: Automated authentication success rate tracking
- **VM-002**: Security audit logs analysis
- **VM-003**: User satisfaction surveys
```

## 3. Strategy Exploration

```
# Strategy Exploration: Authentication Implementation

## Strategy 1: Library-First Approach
- **Approach**: Use established authentication libraries (like Auth0, Firebase Auth, or similar)
- **Pros**: Well-tested, secure, maintained by experts, faster implementation
- **Cons**: Vendor lock-in, cost implications, less control over implementation
- **Effort Estimate**: 2 weeks
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Alignment with Goals**: High - meets security and timeline requirements

## Strategy 2: Custom Implementation
- **Approach**: Build authentication system from scratch using standard protocols
- **Pros**: Full control, no vendor lock-in, customizable security measures
- **Cons**: Higher risk of security vulnerabilities, longer development time
- **Effort Estimate**: 8 weeks
- **Risk Level**: High
- **Alignment with Goals**: Medium - may meet security but risks timeline

## Recommended Strategy: Strategy 1 (Library-First Approach)
**Rationale**: Best balance of security, timeline, and reliability. Meets all goal objectives with lower risk.
```

## 4. Milestone Plan

```
# Implementation Plan: Authentication System

## Milestone 1: Core Authentication (Priority: P1)
- **Objective**: Implement secure email/password authentication
- **Success Criteria**: Users can authenticate with 99.9% success rate within 2 seconds
- **Deliverables**: Authentication API, user database, security validation
- **Timeline**: Weeks 1-2
- **Resources Needed**: 1 backend developer, authentication library license
- **Dependencies**: None (foundational)

## Milestone 2: OAuth Integration (Priority: P2)
- **Objective**: Add OAuth support for Google, GitHub, Microsoft
- **Success Criteria**: OAuth authentication available with same security standards
- **Timeline**: Weeks 3-4
- **Dependencies**: Milestone 1 completion

## Milestone 3: Account Recovery (Priority: P3)
- **Objective**: Implement secure account recovery system
- **Success Criteria**: 90% recovery success rate
- **Timeline**: Weeks 5-6
- **Dependencies**: Milestone 1 completion
```

## 5. Execution with Learning Loops

The execution would involve implementing each milestone, validating success criteria, and adjusting approach based on evidence gathered during implementation. This would include:

- Monitoring authentication success rates
- Analyzing security logs
- Gathering user feedback
- Iterating on implementation based on evidence
- Validating continuously against original vision and goals

This example demonstrates how Intent Kit provides a structured approach to development that maintains focus on user intent and measurable outcomes throughout the process.
