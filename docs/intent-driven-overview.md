# Intent-Driven Development Overview

Intent-Driven Development (IDD) is a methodology that prioritizes the user's actual needs and desired outcomes as the primary drivers of the development process, rather than focusing on implementation details or technical requirements alone.

## Core Philosophy

- **Outcome over Implementation**: Focus on measurable user/business outcomes rather than technical implementation details.
- **True Intent Discovery**: Dig deeper to understand what users actually need, not just what they initially request.
- **Adaptive Execution**: Remain flexible in approach while maintaining focus on the original intent.
- **Measurable Success**: Define specific, quantifiable metrics for success from the outset.

## The IDD Process

### 1. Intent Capture
- Understand the user's true goal or desired outcome
- Identify success metrics and measurable outcomes
- Clarify the "why" behind the request
- Document assumptions and constraints

### 2. Strategy Exploration
- Research multiple approaches to fulfill the intent
- Evaluate the trade-offs between different strategies
- Consider technical feasibility, resources, and timeline
- Select the optimal approach based on evidence

### 3. Implementation
- Execute with learning loops and continuous validation
- Adapt approach based on evidence and feedback
- Maintain alignment with original intent
- Document decisions and learnings

### 4. Validation
- Measure results against original intent and success metrics
- Assess whether the implementation truly fulfilled the user's needs
- Gather feedback on the outcome
- Document lessons learned for future intents

## Key Principles

1. **Start with Why**: Always understand the underlying reason for a request
2. **Focus on Outcomes**: Prioritize what needs to be achieved over how it's implemented
3. **Validate Assumptions**: Continuously verify that approach aligns with intent
4. **Be Adaptive**: Change course when evidence suggests a better approach
5. **Measure Success**: Define success criteria upfront and track against them
