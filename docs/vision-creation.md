# Vision Creation Guide

Creating a strong vision is the foundation of successful Intent-Driven Development. A well-crafted vision document serves as the North Star for all subsequent development decisions.

## Key Elements of a Strong Vision

### 1. Clear User Intent
Focus on what the user is trying to accomplish, not how they might accomplish it. The vision should capture the core need or desire that drives the project.

### 2. Measurable Outcomes
Define specific, quantifiable outcomes that indicate the vision has been achieved. These should be technology-agnostic and focused on value delivered to users or stakeholders.

### 3. Success Criteria
Establish concrete metrics that will validate whether the vision has been successfully implemented. These criteria should be measurable, achievable, and relevant.

### 4. Scope Definition
Clearly define what is in scope and what is out of scope to provide focus and prevent feature creep.

## The Vision Creation Process

### Step 1: Understand the "Why"
Begin by understanding the underlying reason for the request. This often involves asking questions like:
- What problem is the user trying to solve?
- What outcomes are they hoping to achieve?
- What would success look like to them?

### Step 2: Identify Stakeholders
Determine who has a vested interest in the success of the project. Different stakeholders may have different perspectives on success.

### Step 3: Define Outcomes
Translate the user's needs into specific, measurable outcomes. These should be:
- Specific: Clearly defined with no ambiguity
- Measurable: Quantifiable in some way
- Achievable: Realistic given constraints
- Relevant: Aligned with user needs
- Time-bound: Associated with a timeframe if possible

### Step 4: Validate Understanding
Present the vision back to stakeholders to ensure alignment and make adjustments as needed.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Focusing on implementation**: Keep the vision focused on user intent, not technical solutions
- **Vague outcomes**: Ensure success criteria are specific and measurable
- **Missing stakeholder input**: Include perspectives from all affected parties
- **Overreaching scope**: Keep the vision focused on core value delivery
