# Goal Definition Guide

Goals translate the high-level vision into specific, measurable objectives that can guide development efforts. Well-defined goals provide clear targets and validation criteria.

## Key Elements of Effective Goals

### 1. Specific Objectives
Each goal should clearly define what needs to be achieved. Avoid vague language and ensure the objective is unambiguous.

### 2. Measurable Criteria
Establish specific metrics that will indicate goal achievement. These should be quantifiable and allow for objective assessment of progress.

### 3. Alignment with Vision
Ensure each goal directly supports one or more elements of the project vision. Goals should be traceable back to specific user intents.

### 4. Feasibility Assessment
Goals should be achievable within the constraints of available resources, technology, and timeframe.

## The Goal Definition Process

### Step 1: Map to Vision
Identify which elements of the vision each goal will address. This ensures goals remain aligned with the original user intent.

### Step 2: Define Success Metrics
For each goal, establish clear metrics that will validate achievement. These metrics should be:
- Quantitative when possible
- Measurable with available tools
- Relevant to the user's needs
- Time-sensitive with clear baselines

### Step 3: Identify Validation Approaches
Determine how each goal's success will be measured and validated. This might include:
- Automated tracking systems
- User feedback mechanisms
- Performance metrics
- Business impact measures

### Step 4: Assess Dependencies and Resources
Identify what resources are needed to achieve each goal and any dependencies between goals.

## Prioritizing Goals

Goals should be prioritized based on their importance to achieving the overall vision and their impact on users. Consider:
- Criticality to core user needs
- Dependencies on other goals
- Available resources
- Risk factors

## Validation and Adaptation

Goals are not set in stone. As evidence is gathered during implementation, goals may need to be refined or adjusted while maintaining alignment with the original vision. This adaptive approach is a key principle of Intent-Driven Development.
