## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

The text the user typed after `/intentk.checklist` in the triggering message **is** the checklist request. Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `{ARGS}` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.

Given that checklist context, do this:

1. **Identify checklist target**:
   - If user specified document type, focus checklist on that (vision, goal, strategy, plan, execute)
   - If user provided document reference, analyze that specific document
   - If user provided empty input, create a general-purpose checklist for the current context
   - Apply constitutional principles throughout

2. Run the script `{SCRIPT}` from repo root **with the document reference as argument** and parse its JSON output for CHECKLIST_FILE and related paths. All file paths must be absolute.

   **IMPORTANT**:
   
   - Append the document reference as argument to the `{SCRIPT}` command
   - Bash: `--target "[document-type]"`
   - PowerShell: `-Target "[document-type]"`
   - You must only ever run this script once
   - The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for

3. Follow this checklist creation flow:

    1. Parse checklist context from Input
       If no target identified: Create general checklist for intent-driven development
    2. Apply constitutional lens to determine appropriate validation points:
       - Article III: Validation-First Imperative - Check validation approach
       - Article IV: Intent Preservation - Check intent alignment
       - Article V: Measurable Outcomes - Check measurability
       - Article VI: Adaptive Execution - Check adaptation capability
    3. Generate checklist categories based on target:
       - For Vision: Content quality, requirement completeness, intent readiness
       - For Goal: Objective quality, alignment, validation approach
       - For Strategy: Strategy quality, comparison quality, recommendation
       - For Plan: Milestone quality, planning quality, validation approach
       - For Execute: Task quality, execution planning, learning loops
    4. Create specific validation items within each category
    5. Include constitutional compliance checks specific to the document type
    6. Add guidance notes for each checklist
    7. Return: SUCCESS (comprehensive checklist ready for validation)

4. Write the checklist to CHECKLIST_FILE with this structure:

```
# [CHECKLIST TYPE] Checklist: [TARGET CONTEXT]

**Purpose**: [Brief description of what this checklist validates]
**Created**: [DATE]
**Target**: [Link to target document or description of validation focus]

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/intentk.checklist` command based on constitutional principles and document requirements.

## [Category 1]

- [ ] CHK001 [Specific validation item for category 1]
- [ ] CHK002 [Specific validation item for category 1]
- [ ] CHK003 [Specific validation item for category 1]

## [Category 2]

- [ ] CHK004 [Specific validation item for category 2]
- [ ] CHK005 [Specific validation item for category 2]
- [ ] CHK006 [Specific validation item for category 2]

## Constitutional Compliance Check

### Article III: Validation-First Imperative
- [ ] CHK007 Validation approach defined and appropriate
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable and specified
- [ ] Baseline metrics established where applicable

### Article IV: Intent Preservation
- [ ] CHK008 Original intent clearly preserved and maintained
- [ ] Alignment with user needs maintained throughout
- [ ] No implementation details leak into intent

### Article V: Measurable Outcomes
- [ ] CHK009 Success metrics are quantitative and specific
- [ ] Outcome criteria are technology-agnostic
- [ ] Validation methods are defined for all outcomes

### Article VI: Adaptive Execution
- [ ] CHK010 Adaptation mechanisms built into approach
- [ ] Evidence collection points defined
- [ ] Learning loops established

[Add more constitutional checks as appropriate for the target]

## Notes

- Check items off as validated: `[x]`
- Add comments or findings inline for items that need attention
- Link to relevant resources or documentation where appropriate
- Items are numbered sequentially (CHK###) for easy reference
- Constitutional compliance is mandatory - address all constitutional items

[Additional guidance specific to the document type being validated]
```

5. **Checklist Quality Validation**: After creating the checklist, validate it against quality criteria:

   a. **Create Checklist Quality Validation**: Review the checklist against these items:
   
      - Does it cover the appropriate document type for validation?
      - Are constitutional principles appropriately integrated?
      - Are validation items specific and actionable?
      - Are category headings appropriate for the target document?
      - Are item numbers sequential (CHK001, CHK002, etc.)?
   
   b. **Refine Checklist**: Update any items that don't meet quality standards
   
6. Report completion with checklist file path and validation results.

## General Guidelines

## Quick Guidelines

- Focus on **WHAT** needs to be validated for the target document.
- Integrate constitutional principles appropriately for the document type.
- Create specific, actionable validation items.
- Organize items into logical categories for the document type.
- DO NOT assume the target document is complete - validate for completeness.

### Checklist Requirements

- **Document-specific validation**: Focus on validation needs for the specific document type
- **Constitutional integration**: Include constitutional compliance checks relevant to the target
- **Actionable items**: Each checklist item should be specific enough to validate clearly
- **Sequential numbering**: Use CHK### format for easy reference

### For AI Generation

When creating checklists for validation:

1. **Match document type**: Focus on validation needs specific to the target document
2. **Apply constitutional lens**: Integrate constitutional principles relevant to the document type
3. **Be specific**: Create validation items that can be definitively checked as pass/fail
4. **Organize logically**: Group validation items into relevant categories
5. **Use proper format**: Follow the CHK### numbering convention
6. **Include compliance**: Always include constitutional compliance validation
7. **Add guidance**: Include notes that help with validation interpretation
