## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before strategy evaluation begins. Re-check after strategy selection.*

### Phase -1: Pre-Strategy Gates
#### Simplicity Gate (Article VII)
- [ ] Each strategy is focused on single primary approach?
- [ ] No over-engineering or complex multi-part strategies?

#### Anti-Abstraction Gate (Article VIII)  
- [ ] Strategies define direct validation approaches (not indirect abstractions)?
- [ ] Using direct evidence collection rather than proxy measures?

#### Integration-First Gate (Article IX)
- [ ] Each strategy includes validation method definition?
- [ ] Validation approaches can be tested with real data/feedback?
